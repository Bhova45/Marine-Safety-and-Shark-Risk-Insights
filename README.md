Marine Safety and Shark Risk Insights 
Overview
This project analyzes global shark attack data with a focus on:

Geographic and activity-related risk factors

Victim demographics (especially age)

Trends in attack frequency and fatality rates

Robust data cleaning and statistical methods provide actionable insights for targeted safety and prevention strategies.

Data Preparation & Cleaning
Applied data normalization on columns:

Country, Activity, Species, Age, Year, Fatal Y/N

Missing values imputed (e.g., median for numerical data).

Used regular expressions to extract and standardize values (especially for age, location).

Key Findings
Geographic Trends: Most attacks occurred in the USA, Australia, and South Africa.

Activities at Risk: Surfing, swimming, fishing, and spearfishing were the most common activities.

Fatality rates are higher for swimming than surfing.

Demographics: Nearly 80% of victims are under 30 years old.

Fatality Distribution: Fatal attacks are most frequent where attacks are most common (e.g., USA, Australia, South Africa).

Hypothesis Testing
Attack location: Confirmed high risk in the USA and Australia.

Activity fatality: Fatality rates are higher for swimmers than surfers.

Victim age: Majority of victims under 30 years old.

Seasonality: Indications of seasonal trends; more granular analysis recommended.

Recommendations
Focus prevention efforts on youth engaging in high-risk activities in major hotspot countries.

Improve safety measures and awareness at beaches, especially in the USA, Australia, and South Africa.

Encourage protective practices among swimmers, who experience a higher fatality rate.

Explore temporal trends for refined safety recommendations.

Analytical Strengths
Advanced data cleaning and imputation techniques.

Validation of hypotheses with clear, quantifiable metrics.

Visualizations and descriptive statistics support clarity and practical insight.

Next Steps
Incorporate further temporal analysis (e.g., by month/season).

Develop visual dashboards for ongoing monitoring.

Continue expanding dataset for greater accuracy.
